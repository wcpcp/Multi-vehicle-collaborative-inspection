# Multi-vehicle-collaborative-inspection
Multi vehicle collaborative inspection
This is a multi vehicle collaborative inspection project about simulating military bases. By simulating military bases in Gazebo, six autonomous vehicles were constructed for patrols. In this project, full coverage path planning and local trajectory optimization are constructed. During the patrol, the unmanned vehicle detected the suspect and issued a warning.
